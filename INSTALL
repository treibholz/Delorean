INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS



# On the client

add the following line to your /etc/crontab

	23 * * * * root /path/to/delorean.sh

This will run delorean every hour at HH:23

Now create an ssh-key whithout a passphrase for your root-user:

	ssh-keygen

Optionally put delorean.default.example to /etc/default/delorean and fill it
with your settings in case your server is not called "backupserver".



# On the server

Optional, but very strongly recommended:

create a dedicated user e.g. "delorean"

	# useradd -d /srv/delorean delorean

You shall not give this user a password! Create
/srv/delorean/.ssh/authorized_keys and put the public-ssh key of the
root-user into it.

# And now?

That's all. Now run delorean.sh the first-time manually, so you can accept
the host-key of your server and do the  initial full-backup.
