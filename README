Delorean is a backup-solution for desktop-computers and especially for
notebooks. All backups suck, this one just sucks less.

It was inspired by rsnapshot and Time Machine on Mac OS X.

It is written in bash and uses nothing else but standard Linux-tools like
rsync, ssh and ionice.

TODO: better documentation.

Q: Why not just use rsnapshot?
A: rsnapshot cannot push backups through ssh, it is just able to pull them.

Q: Why not Time Machine?
A: I don't have a Mac (and I don't want one)
A: It only works fine over the network with netatalk, which is a PITA.

Q: So what are the advantages and uniqe features of delorean?
A: It pushes backups via ssh to a server and then drops the copy-as-hardlinks-
   command on the server, so you have less load on your machine.

Q: And what are the disadvantages?
A: You need an "intelligent" server, not only a USB-drive (use rsnaphot then)
   or a simple NAS. You need ssh and rsync (and optionally a dedicated user
   and a filesystem, that can handle user_xattr on the destination drive),
   but you don't a special software or a service (except ssh of course)
   running there! You should be able to get this running on OpenWRT-based
   Wifi-router with a USB-disk. For further information, read the
   instructions in the file INSTALL.
