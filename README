Delorean is a backup-solution for desktop-computers and especially for
notebooks.

It was inspired by rsnapshot and TimeMachine on Mac OS X.

It is written in bash and uses nothing else but standard Linux-tools like
rsync, ssh and ionice.



Q: Why not just use rsnapshot?
A: rsnapshot cannot push backups through ssh, it is just able to pull them.

Q: Why not TimeMachine?
A: I don't have a Mac (and I don't want one)
A: It only works fine over the network with netatalk, which is a PITA.

Q: So what are the advantages and uniqe features of delorean?
A: (TODO)
